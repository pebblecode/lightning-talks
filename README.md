# pebble lighting talks

pebble holds lightning talks at 5.30 p.m. on the last Wednesday of each month.

Each talk should be 5-15 minutes long and can be on anything.

Stuff you are interested in and think others might be interested in too:

dev, design, art, science, brewing....
what you are working on during 10% time or even cool things you learnt recently.

Drinks will be provided and talks should wrap up just after 6 p.m.

If you'd like to talk please open [an issue][1]
